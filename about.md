I'm a freelance front end developer who brings a different persepctive to projects using the skills I gathered in my past adventures as a photographer and writer. Hopefully this page will give you a quick glance at my personality that you might not see on just my resume. Please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Finding my Passion

After graduating from Appalachian State with a BA in English and a Minor in Communications focusing on digital media, I realized, I hadn't quite found what direction I wanted my career to advance in. For the longest time, I wanted to find a job that allowed me to explore my creative talents. This lead me to an indecisive four years at college switching my major from music management, to photography, to journalism, finally settling on English. But as I searched for a job post graduation, nothing caught my eye. I kept going back to the brief time I spent as the Webmaster for the Equestrian Club on campus.

The decision to become a developer stemmed from the realization that I could combine all of the different interests I had in writing, photography, and design into a single career. I relish any opportunity to use my unique combination of creative skills to bring a project to life. I hope some of that passion is visible through this page. Please feel free to contact me with any projects, ideas, or suggestions.
